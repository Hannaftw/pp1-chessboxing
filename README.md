## Features
### Existing Features
In this section I will include screenshots and descriptions of the different features on the site, describe why they were included and how they help provide a good UX and also is in line with the goal of the site.

__Navigation Bar__
- The navigation bar is avaliable and identical on on all four pages and shows the user through highlighting the current page where on the site they are. 
- For the mobile version the navigation bar is a dropdown menu whilst on the other screen sizes it is a list of links to the other pages.
- Through this feature the user can easily navigate between the pages of the site, no matter what device they are using without having to use a "back" button. 

__The Footer__ 
- Included on all four pages and provides the user with clear information about social media contacts through links in the form of icons, all links to external sites open in a new tab.
- It also informs the user about copyright, the creator of the site as well as a link to access the source code through the GitHub repository. 

__Photo gallery__
- On three of the pages photo galleries are present in the form of a "carousel" you can click though. Each picture is accompanied by a short description in text form as well as and "alt" description and aria labels for accessability. 
- Using this design for the gallery feature allows the user to decide how much of the media material they want to engage with. It also makes it possible for the site owner to provide several images without the page being cluttered.
