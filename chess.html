            <h2>A breif history of Chess</h2>
            <p>
              The game of chess, a chessboxing cornerstone, has a rich history
              that spans over 1500 years. Originating in India during the 6th
              century, chess began as 'Chaturanga', a game representing the four
              divisions of the Indian army: infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and
              chariotry. This early form of chess was a strategic, two-player
              war game reflecting the complexities of battle.
              <br />
              <br />
              It was in Europe during the Middle Ages that chess underwent
              significant transformations, with modifications to rules and
              design that led to the version of chess we are familiar with.
              Chess has historically permeated all levels of society,
              symbolising strategic thinking and intellectual prowess. The
              appeal of chess lies in its blend of simple rules and complex
              strategies, making it a fitting intellectual counterpart to the
              physical demands of boxing, truly testing both mind and body.

            <h2>Chess today: online playing and AI</h2>
            <p>
              Chess is bigger today than it has been in many years, it has
              become more mainstream and more and more people are drawn to this
              simple yet so complex game. This dispite all of the new technology
              and games that are available. There was a large boost in
              popularity during the pandemic, for obvious resons perhaps, and
              many were inspired by the netflix series

              In the modern era, chess has embraced the digital world,
              revolutionising how it is played. It has become a global game and
              players from all over the world can play matches against each
              other.

              have democratised the game, providing availability to anyone with
              internet access, and has played an integral part in creating a
              growing global community of chess enthusiasts. Platforms offer
              various game formats such as "classic" and speed/blitz chess (the
              version played in chessboxing). There is something for everyone,
              from beginners to grandmasters. Players can access tools for
              learning and improvement, tutorials, analysis of games, and the
              ability to replay games in order to study them closer.

              <br />
              Alongside the impact of the internet a significant milestone in
              modern chess is the integration of AI. It began in 1997 when IBM's
              Deep Blue defeated reigning world champion Garry Kasparov. AI has
              many uses within the game, it can be used as both a powerful
              opponent to practice against or as a coach. Algorithms can analyse
              games, identify weaknesses, and suggest tailored methods for
              improvement. Technology has expanded chess theory, computers
              discover new strategies that have enriched the game's strategic
              depth. Generally, and in chessboxing, the timeless game still
              remains relevant and adapts to the times, blending tradition and
              technological innovation to challenge players intellect.

          <h2>The objective of Chess</h2>
          <h3>- a short overlook of the rules</h3>
          <p>
            Chess is played on a square board in an eight-by-eight grid. One
            player plays with black pieces and the other with white pieces, the
            player that plays white always starts the game. Players begins with
            16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops,
            and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with
            the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn.
            To learn about the different pieces and how they move as well as a
            more in depth explanation of the rules, you can visit sites such as
            <a href="https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess">
              chess.com
            </a>
            or
            <a href="https://www.chesscademy.com/"> chesscademy.com </a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            The objective of the game, how you win, is by checkmate, meaning the
            opponent's king is placed under an inescapable threat of capture. To
            achieve this, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the
            opponent's pieces. If there is not a checkmate, a player wins the
            game if the opponent resigns, or runs out of time (in times games).
            A game can also end in a draw in several ways.

            When thinking of influencial and skilled players of chess, the name
            of this man will appear to many. People may know his name and
            incredible chess skills but there are several things that people are
            usually not aware of. Some interesting facts about are: he is the
            youngest player ever to earn the title "grandmaster", he was an
            outspoken supporter of nazism and publically wore nazi symbols, such
            as a pin on his lapel, even during chess games and tournaments. He
            was notoriously difficult to deal with, hated america and refused to
            play matches even after the president pleaded with him. To say the
            least, he was quite the character, strong opinions and no problem
            expressing these. Here are some of the quotes uttered by the chess
            legend, and yes he actually did say these things...

          <h3>"Wise" words from chess legend Bobby Fisher</h3>
          <ul class="chess-quotes">
            <li>
              <q>
                Chess is war over the board. The object is to crush the
                opponent's mind.
              </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q> I like the moment when I break a man's ego </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q> I don't believe in psychology. I believe in good moves. </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q>
                I object to being called a chess genius because I consider
                myself to be and all around genius who just happens to play
                chess, which is rather different.
              </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q>
                I'm not afraid of Spassky. The world knows I'm the best. You
                don't need a match to prove it.
              </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q> I'm the best Fischer that ever lived. </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q>
                I'm the most famous, the most studied, the most uncompromising,
                the most difficult, the most brilliant, and the most important
                chess player in the history of the game.
              </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q>
                A piece of garbage like Kasparov might be called a chess genius,
                but he's like an idiot savant. Outside of chess he knows
                nothing.
              </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q>
                People have been playing against me below their strength for
                fifteen years.
              </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q>
                My opponents make good moves too. Sometimes I don't take these
                things into consideration.
              </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q> I add status to any tournament I attend. </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q>
                They asked me what year it was, what month it was, etc. I easily
                answered these stupid questions.
              </q>
            </li>
            <li>
              <q> Is it against the law to kill a reporter? </q>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Something tells me that this man would not do very well in a game of
            chessboxing, but surely many people would want to meet up with him
            in the ring. Maybe a genious like him wouldn't stoop so low, seeing
            as he believed "blitz chess kills your ideas".
