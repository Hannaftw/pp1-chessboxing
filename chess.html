            <h2>A breif history of Chess</h2>
            <p>
              The game of chess, a chessboxing cornerstone, has a rich history
              that spans over 1500 years. Originating in India during the 6th
              century, chess began as 'Chaturanga', a game representing the four
              divisions of the Indian army: infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and
              chariotry. This early form of chess was a strategic, two-player
              war game reflecting the complexities of battle.
              <br />
              <br />
              It was in Europe during the Middle Ages that chess underwent
              significant transformations, with modifications to rules and
              design that led to the version of chess we are familiar with.
              Chess has historically permeated all levels of society,
              symbolising strategic thinking and intellectual prowess. The
              appeal of chess lies in its blend of simple rules and complex
              strategies, making it a fitting intellectual counterpart to the
              physical demands of boxing, truly testing both mind and body.

          <h2>The objective of Chess</h2>
          <p>
            Chess is played on a square board in an eight-by-eight grid. One
            player plays with black pieces and the other with white pieces, the
            player that plays white always starts the game. Players begins with
            16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops,
            and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently, with
            the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn.
            To learn about the different pieces and how they move as well as a
            more in depth explanation of the rules, you can visit sites such as
            <a href="https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess">
              chess.com
            </a>
            or
            <a href="https://www.chesscademy.com/"> chesscademy.com </a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            The objective of the game, how you win, is by checkmate, meaning the
            opponent's king is placed under an inescapable threat of capture. To
            achieve this, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the
            opponent's pieces. If there is not a checkmate, a player wins the
            game if the opponent resigns, or runs out of time (in timed games).
            A game can also end in a draw in several ways, some of which are mentioned below.

          <h3>Some chess terms explained</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>FIDE</b> - The World Chess Federation, (the acronym comes from the French "Fédération Internationale des Échecs"), is an international organization 
              that connects the various national chess federations around the world and acts as the governing body of international chess competition. 
              It is responsible for the rules of chess, the rating system and giving players titles depending on their official FIDE rating.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Check</b> - When a player's king is under attack by at least one of the opponent's pieces. The player must get out of check on the next move, otherwise the game is lost.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Checkmate</b> - The term "checkmate" in chess comes from the Persian phrase "Shah Mat," which means "the King is helpless" or "the King is ambushed". 
              The medieval Latin version of this phrase was "scaccus mat," which directly led to the English "checkmate". It signifies a situation where the king is in a position 
              to be captured (in check) and cannot escape to any other square, leading to the end of the game. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Chess ratings</b> - there is a differentiation between online and over-the-board ratings. FIDE rating is calculated based on over-the-board performances in rated tournaments. 
              Ratings start from 1000 and can go above 2800 for elite players. Online ratings are completely separate from the FIDE ratings and they do not affect each other.
              Chess websites have their own rating systems for online play, these are usually specific to platforms and can vary significantly. They may include different categories like blitz, rapid, bullet, and daily/classical games.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Grandmaster</b> - The highest title a chess player can attain awarded by the world chess federation FIDE. In order to be given this title a player must reach a rating of at least 2500 and achieve three grandmaster norms.
              The requirements for a GM norm include: a rating of at least 2600 in the tournament, playing against a certain number of other titled players, including a minimum number of existing Grandmasters,
              competing in a tournament that meets specific criteria for international diversity, such as having players from multiple chess federations and achieving this level of performance in a minimum number of games, typically 9.
              When these requirements are met, the player is said to have "made a norm", and the tournament is called a "norm tournament". After achieving the required norms and rating, 
              the player's application for the Grandmaster title is submitted to FIDE for official approval.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Stalemate</b> - When the player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check. The game ends in a draw.

            Bobby Fisher - some "interesting" facts
          </h2>
          <p>
            Bobby Fisher is known for his outstanding chess skills but there are several things that people are often not aware of. 
            Some interesting facts: he is the youngest player ever to earn the title "grandmaster" at the age of 15, 
            he developed a variant of chess known as "Fischer Random Chess" or "Chess960" to emphasize skill over memorized opening sequences,
            he was anoutspoken anti-semite and wore anti-semitic symbols, such
            as a pin on his lapel (even during chess games), he was notoriously difficult to deal with with many "quirks", 
            he often stated that he hated america and refused to play matches even after the president himself would plead with him. 
            He was quite the character with strong opinions and no problem expressing them. Here are some of the quotes uttered by the chess
            legend, and yes he actually did say these things...

            Something tells me that this man would not do very well in a game of

            in the ring. Maybe a genious like him wouldn't stoop so low, seeing
            as he believed "blitz chess kills your ideas".

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Well, first of all I can say I set out to make this page as a way to learn more about chess myself, and I have learned a lot. It was supposed to be a basic and simple page, 
          but I got carried away and it became a bit more than that. Even though there is way more on this page than I may have initially planned, I have barely scratched the surface of the world of chess.
          So, imagine that you have to master this game in order to be able to play chessboxing, it is a lot to take in. But if you have made it this far and have not opened a tab to watch some reaction video 
          or just some cute cats on any media player, I say cudos to you. You seem to have what it takes to become a chessboxer, should you want to walk this path. If you are interested in

            href="chessboxing.html"
            aria-label="internal link to the page chessboxing"chessboxing>chessboxing
          </a>, 
            you are probably already interested in chess, but if you were not I hope this page, even with it's mammoth length and, has managed to spark some interest. My enthusiasm have perhaps been a bit contagious, I am not one to hide my emotions very well. 
            Maybe you will even try it out, dust off that board you have somewhere in the attic or basement. Or you mat watch a game or two, now that matches, live and not, are so widely avaliable.
          <br>

          It is of  course not necessary to be a professional chess player to enjoy chessboxing, but it is a good idea to have some knowledge of the game, even if it's not your favorite part of the sport.
          Most chessboxers are not grandmasters (actually I don't think there is any grandmaster that has taken part in a chessboxing match, I will have to look that up), but they are usually quite good at chess. 
          The best chessboxers are usually the ones that are good at both chess and boxing, which is not very surprising. It's not enough to be good at one of the sports, you have to be good at both. But even if you are good at both,
          you can still have a favorite. You may be more interested in the 
          <a

          </a> 
          part of the sport and is itching to learn more about that part of the sport. Or you feel like you just can't wait any longer and you need to know more about

          without any further delay. If that is so, you do you, choose your own path whilst we explore the world of chessboxing together.
