          Anyone can deduce that, right? It seems so simple butâ€¦ how do
          these two very different sports get combined into one? Who would be crazy enough to think of such a thing? 
          Surely it is a joke, a prank, a hoax? But, no, it is not. It is a real sport and the creator had some help along the way,
          but more on that later.

            <br />
          When you are introduced to the concept of this majestic sport a whole lot of questions are surely popping up in your head.
          Questions such as: Why have I never heard of this? This is so brilliant and is so unlikely that it just makes perfect sense, why have I not thought of this? 
          Am I being pranked and the next link I click will take me to some kind of meme, rick-roll or something of that nature? Is this what was missing in my life, the part that I always wondered if I would feel like it was missing something?
          Has the final piece of the puzzle has been found and it is chessboxing? 
          These are difficult and important questions for sure but maybe the most common and burning question may be: <i style="color: red; font-weight: 700; font-size: 22px;">why?</i>

            <br>
            <br>
            So, let us continue our journey with a with a brief introduction to this fantastic sport. If your interest is not piqued after this, I am at a loss and though it seems very unlikely, 
            you may be an individual that is not entertained and fascinated by a sport that combines the intellectual challenge of the classic game of chess with the physical challenge of the old and beloved sport of boxing.
            What is not to be intrigued by? Not only does it seem so unlikely that it is almost unbelievable, it has an origin that is more fascinating than perhaps any other sport in our modern era.*
            How can it's origin story be so special you ask? Well, not many sports are born in the mind of a French writer and artist of graphic novels and come to life though a Dutch performance artist who dedicated his life to the sport,
            making it into what it is now, a real sport with competitions and athletes that love the sport as much as it's creator.

          <h3>An introduction to chessboxing</h3>
            <p>     
              <b>What is it?</b> 
              A hybrid sport that combines alternating
              rounds of boxing and chess in the most glorious fashion.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Who would do such a thing?</b>
              There are several amateur clubs but also official international
              competitions managed by The World Chessboxing Organization
              (WCBO). (the name of the international foundation, link new
              tab). To compete professionally a player needs to have both
              knowledge and experience of chess and be deemed physically fit
              enough for boxing.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>How do you win?</b> 
              By knocking out your opponent in the
              boxing ring or defeating them on the chessboard, you do not have
              to win both events in order to win the match.
