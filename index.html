              <b>What is it?</b> A hybrid sport that combines alternating rounds
              of boxing and chess.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Who would do such a thing?</b>
              There are several amateur clubs but also official international
              competitions managed by The World Chessboxing Organization (WCBO).
              (the name of the international foundation, link new tab). To
              compete professionally a player needs to have both knowledge and
              experience of chess and be deemed physically fit enough for
              boxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>How do you win?</b> By knocking out your opponent in the boxing
              ring or defeating them on the chessboard, you do not have to win
              both events in order to win the match.
