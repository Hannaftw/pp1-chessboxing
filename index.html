          Anyone can deduce that, right? It seems so simple butâ€¦ how do
          these two very different sports get combined into one? Who would be crazy enough to think of such a thing? 
          Surely it is a joke, a prank, a hoax? But, no, it is not. It is a real sport and the creator had some help along the way,
          but more on that later.

          When you are introduced to the concept of this majestic sport a whole lot of questions are surely popping up in your head.
          Questions such as: Why have I never heard of this? This is so brilliant and is so unlikely that it just makes perfect sense, why have I not thought of this? 
          Am I being pranked and the next link I click will take me to some kind of meme, rick-roll or something of that nature? Is this what was missing in my life, the part that I always wondered if I would feel like it was missing something?
          Has the final piece of the puzzle has been found and it is chessboxing? 
          These are difficult and important questions for sure but maybe the most common and burning question may be: <span id="home-question">why?</span>

            So, let us continue our journey with a with a brief introduction to this fantastic sport. If your interest is not piqued after this, I am at a loss and though it seems very unlikely, 
            you may be an individual that is not entertained and fascinated by a sport that combines the intellectual challenge of the classic game of chess with the physical challenge of the old and beloved sport of boxing.
            What is not to be intrigued by? Not only does it seem so unlikely that it is almost unbelievable, it has an origin that is more fascinating than perhaps any other sport in our modern era.*
            How can it's origin story be so special you ask? Well, not many sports are born in the mind of a French writer and artist of graphic novels and come to life though a Dutch performance artist who dedicated his life to the sport,
            making it into what it is now, a real sport with competitions and athletes that love the sport as much as it's creator.

            <p>     
              <b>Ok, what is it, really?</b> 
              The short answer is: A hybrid sport that combines alternating rounds of boxing and chess in the most glorious fashion. But as you will learn, under the surface, it is so much more than that.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Who would think of such a thing?</b>
              A genious or a madman? Perhaps someone who created a bridge between madness and genious? Not being defined as either but as genious, one with some crazy tendencies. 
              The sport is a result of more than one creative mind. It all began when a Dutch performance artist got his hands on a French graphic novel set in a dystopian future. 
              In this future, a sport similar to our modern version of chessboxing was the most popular sport. The artist was so intrigued by this sport that he decided to make it a reality, 
              first as a piece of performance art, since he was an artist after all. But it did not stop there, he was so dedicated that he created a foundation for the sport and made it into what it is today.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Are there people that are actually partaking in this sport?</b> Yes, there are plenty and the number keeps growing. There are several amateur clubs but also events where the participants are
              on professional level. These official international competitions managed by The World Chessboxing Organization
              (WCBO). To compete professionally a player needs to have both knowledge and experience of chess and be deemed physically fit enough for boxing.

              This might be what some picture when they hear the word chessboxing. It is of course not as incredible as the actual sport, 
              but should some maker of games and toys be reading this, I would like to see this as a board game. I would buy it, wouldn't you?

            Maybe now you can really begin to picture it? The battle of wits and the intricate dance of the pieces on the board in the rounds of chess combined with the adrenaline-fueled 
            exchanges in the ring during the sweat-inducing boxing  rounds. It almost sounds too good to be true, but you are not dreaming! This sport is real and has 
            just begun to grow but has without a doubt enormous potential.
