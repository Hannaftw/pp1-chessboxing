            A deeper dive into chessboxing
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's finally time to really get to know the sport of chessboxing.
            It's history, rules and some fun facts. To take a deep dive into a
            sport that's both fascinating and unique and is capturing the
            interest of people all over the world. Blending the intellectual
            challenge of chess, a game with ancient roots that continues to
            evolve in the modern era of online playing and AI opponents, with
            the physical vigour of boxing, one of humanity's oldest physical
            contests. Chessboxing is the perfect blend of mental and physical
            prowess.
            <br>
            <br>
            Historically, we've often admired either strength or smarts, but
            rarely both together. Chessboxing challenges this notion by
            requiring competitors to excel in both strategic thinking and
            physical strength. Competitors must master and be able to switch
            between the focused, strategic world of chess and the intense,
            physically demanding realm of boxing. This demands not just
            intellectual sharpness or physical endurance, but a unique
            combination of both. I it prompts us to reconsider our traditional
            view of the ideal athlete. Perhaps the quintessential chessboxing
            champion represents a new kind of competitor to be admired, one
            who embodies the best of both worlds: mental acuity and physical
            power. When it comes to brains or brawn, it is not longer about
            choosing one over the other; it's about excelling in both areas.

            The history of chessboxing
          </h3>
          <p>
            Invented in 2003 by the Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, but how did he
            come up with the idea? Rubingh was inspired by the 1992 graphic
            novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal. In the graphic novel, set in a
            dystopian future, a version of chessboxing is the most popular sport
            in the world. After reading this, Rubingh, being an artist decided
            to create a live version of the sport as a piece of performance art.
            Luckily, he saw the potential of the sport and decided to create a
            real life version but without the dystopia. Had it not been for this
            stroke of brilliance, the history of chessboxing would have ended as
            a little known piece of performance art .

            A sport like this surely can make you question what abilities that you value the most, brains or brawn? 
            I find myself thinking that of course being good at chess is more impressive than being a strong fighter... or what do I really think?
            It almost seems improssible to decide! Perhaps it's not a question of which is more impressive, but rather which is more important in order for you to prevail?
            On a more personal note, I find myself wondering what kind of competitor I would be. Maybe it would be fun to try it out, but I'm not sure I would be able to handle the pressure.
            Maybe it comes as no surprise that I, the creator of this site has a background both in chess and boxing. But, more on that later as we tie this whole thing together with some reflections and a conclusion.
            But, do think about it, what part of the match do you find most impressive or interesting? 
            Are you one for the muscles or the mind? Would you rather win by checkmate or knockout? Or perhaps a better question would be, would you prefer to be loose in the ring or on the board?

      <!-- Rules section -->
      <section class="rules">
          <div class="container-black">
            <h2>The rules of chessboxing</h2>
            <p>
              The match consists of 12 rounds, 6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds of
              boxing, starting with a chessround. There is a break of 1 minute
              between the rounds to allow the players to change their gear. A
              winner can be declared and the match thus ending in 4 different
              ways:
              <br />
              <b>Checkmate</b> - according to the rules of chess
              <br />
              <b>Knockout</b> - according to the rules of boxing
              <br />
              <b>Technical knockout </b>
              <br />
              <b>Exceeding the time limit in chess</b>
              <br />
              If all rounds are completed and none of the players have won
              through any of these ways, a sixth and last round of boxing takes
              place and the player with the most boxing points from the whole
              game wins. If after this last round it's still a tie, the player
              with the black pieces win.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are separate referees for the rounds of chess and boxing,
              and this is essential. Judging any of the two events of the match
              require a specific set of expertise and focus and it not likely
              that a single induvidual would be able to not just have the
              required knowledge to judge the chess part and the boxing part,
              but also be able to keep focus and switch between these two
              seemlessly. By dividing the responsibilities it helps to ensure
              the integrity and fairness of the separate events and the whole
              match.

              The popular Netflix miniseries “The Queens Gambit” is dedicated to
              the founder Rubingh. He is credited as an “On-Set Chess
              Consultant” for the series.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the 1992 graphic novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal the rules
              were slightly different. A whole boxing match was played before
              the chess game. Rubingh thought that this was impractical and
              adjusted the rules according to his vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first chessboxing win was due to one of the players exceeding
              the time limit in chess.
            </li>
            <li>
              The chess is played on board specially designed for chessboxing,
              exactly how it differs from a regular board is a little unclear.
              It has the same dimensions as a regular board, eight by eight
              squares, and the players have the same set up of pieces as in
              regular chess. The chess clock however is not the same as a
              regular chess clock, it is adapted for speed chess.
            </li>
            <li>
              The founder Iepe Rubingh, was born on the 17th of August (1974) which by pure
              coincidence is the same day of birth as the legendary chess player
              Robert James Fischer... but perhaps more importantly it is also the
              birthday of the maker of this website.

              Always remember you have decided for a combined sport, that means
              you've got to work twice as much and twice as hard as the others.
            </li>
            <li>Control yourself before your opponent does.</li>
            <li>
              If your position on the board is bad, make it a long game, when
              you're on top make it short.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never give up on the board, there will be a next round of boxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fight fair, points deduction hurts twice as much in chessboxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Give it all in every boxing round, you'll have five minutes to
              regenerate afterwards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never follow the chess speed of your opponent, control yourself
              and draw at your own speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Know your opening repertoire with black and white, the quicker you
              are in the opening game the more time you'll have in the middle
              and end game.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are superior in boxing, go for the KO, never count on a
              points win in chessboxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cool down after the boxing, never make your move too soon, you'll
              lose a few seconds on the clock, but it will pay off in the end.

            Apart from the reflections and thought about the sport, I would like to leave you with a personal note. You probably wonder why I have chosen to make a website about chessboxing.
            What is it about this sport that makes me want to share it? Do I practice it or is it something I admire from a distance? For starters, the story of how I found out about chessboxing is not very interesting. 
            As a lover of knowledge, trivia and things that are curious, Ihave an app that gives me a piece of trivia/random fact every time I unlock my phone.
            One day, it was there, the concept of chessboxing was introduced to me. I was intrigued. I had to know more, so naturally I googled it and the more I learned, the more I knew this was something I had to share with the world.

            So why make an entire website about it when there is already a lot of information out there? 
            It just so happens that I was tasked with making a project showcasing that I had mastered the required amount of HTML and CSS, to pass the first part of a program I am attending in order to become a full-stack developer,
            but that is besides the point. So, I needed to create a website and thought that combining my love of learning new things with my love of coding seemed like brilliant idea.
            Additionally, I knew that it was a subject that would probably catch people's attention, judging by the reactions I have gotten when I have mentioned the sport to other people.

            I've always been captivated by human nature, this is precisely why I love chessboxing. It makes me contemplate why we admire greath strength or a superior intellect. I am also puzzled as to why these in many cases are shown as not compatible?
            An example is in movies or tv-series that takes place in high school. Characters will be either nerds or jocks, not both never existing in both spaces.
            In addition to this mostly theoretical fascination of what the game can teach us about our human ways, my interest is also rooted a bit deeper. 
            My connection with chess is quite personal because it brings me closer to my late grandfather. I have no memories of him as I was not even two years old when he passed away in 1990. 
            It has always saddened me that I never got to know him and many times I have imagined how it would be to sit down with him, discussing a wide array of topics and perhaps spending time together with him teaching me chess. 
            Growing up, there was never a question me or my brother had that my father couldn't answer. If he didn't know the answer he'd bring out the encyclopedias (yes this was before smartphones and wikipedia), I have always admired his thirst for knowledge and his ability to learn new things. 
            This is something I am sure he got from his father and that he then passed down to me and my brother. Pardon my digression, but I felt it was important to explain why I feel a connection to chess.
            My grandfather was a passionate player and student of chess, playing chess through the mail as well as in tournaments. I think every room in the house had at least one chessboard, otherwise it would somehow be incomplete. 
            A side note, he was a Professor at Lund University, player and a professor of geology at Lund University*.
            He played chess through the mail as well as over-the-board, meticulously recording each game and later turning these records into bound books. I have one of these books, not because I understand the chess moves, but because it is a piece of my family history I treasure.
             

My journey into boxing began around 17-19 years old, driven by a need to feel empowered after being bullied. Though the bullying was never physical, learning to defend myself, particularly as a female who might not appear formidable, was incredibly reassuring. However, wrist injuries from tennis and handball, leading to surgeries, made boxing a challenge due to the risk of aggravating the scar tissue and I couldn’t continue with the sport which was very disappointing.

Discovering chessboxing was a revelation. It beautifully melded two significant yet contrasting aspects of my life. Beyond the personal connection, I find the sport itself intriguing and entertaining. The blend of mental and physical challenges it presents is unique, and it's a sport I would have loved regardless. But the fact that it combines chess and boxing, both close to my heart for different reasons, makes it all the more special to me.
