            <h3>A deeper dive into chessboxing</h3>
            <p>
              It's finally time to really get to know the sport of chessboxing.
              It's history, rules and some fun facts. To take a deep dive into a
              sport that's both fascinating and unique and is capturing the
              interest of people all over the world. Blending the intellectual
              challenge of chess, a game with ancient roots that continues to
              evolve in the modern era of online playing and AI opponents, with
              the physical vigour of boxing, one of humanity's oldest physical
              contests. Chessboxing is the perfect blend of mental and physical
              prowess.

              Historically, we've often admired either strength or smarts, but
              rarely both together. Chessboxing challenges this notion by
              requiring competitors to excel in both strategic thinking and
              physical strength. Competitors must master and be able to switch
              between the focused, strategic world of chess and the intense,
              physically demanding realm of boxing. This demands not just
              intellectual sharpness or physical endurance, but a unique
              combination of both. I it prompts us to reconsider our traditional
              view of the ideal athlete. Perhaps the quintessential chessboxing
              champion represents a new kind of competitor to be admired– one
              who embodies the best of both worlds: mental acuity and physical
              power. When it comes to brains or brawn, it’s not longer about
              choosing one over the other; it's about excelling in both arenas.

              The founder Iepe Rubingh, is essential to the history of
              chessboxing, so we will get hyped up with a quote from him that he
              uttered after his first chessboxing match.
            </p>
            <q>
              I had been fighting for 45 minutes and I was ready to drop. I
              mobilised every nerve-ending in my body, and landed a punch. I
              could see him struggling to find his corner. All I needed was
              another hit for the victory! ... then the bell rang, and the the
              boxing round ended. I wanted to scream, and the next thing I saw
              was the chess table in the ring, and the final round had begun...
            </q>
            <p>
              We mere mortals may be able to get a sense of what the sport is
              like from videos, images and stories, perhaps this quote from the
              founder and first champion can give us insight into the
              extraordinary experience of stepping into the ring, as well
              sitting down at the chess board.

          <h3>The history of chessboxing</h3>
          <p>
            Invented in 2003 by the Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, but how did he
            come up with the idea? Rubingh was inspired by the 1992 graphic
            novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal. In the graphic novel, set in a
            dystopian future, a version of chessboxing is the most popular sport
            in the world. After reading this, Rubingh, being an artist
            decided to create a live version of the sport as a piece of
            performance art. Luckily, he saw the potential of the sport and
            decided to create a real life version but without the dystopia. Had
            it not been for this stroke of brilliance, the history of
            chessboxing would have ended as a little known piece of performance
            art .

            <h2>The rules of chessboxing</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The match consists of 12 rounds, 6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds
                of boxing, starting with a chessround. There is a break of 1
                minute between the rounds to allow the players to change their
                gear.
              </li>
              <li>
                A winner can be declared and the match thus ending in 4
                different ways:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Checkmate</b> - according to the rules of chess</li>
                  <li><b>Knockout</b> - according to the rules of boxing</li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Technical knockout </b>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <b>Exceeding the time limit in chess</b>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                If all rounds are completed and none of the players have won
                through any of these ways, a sixth and last round of boxing
                takes place and the player with the most boxing points from the
                whole game wins.
              </li>
              <li>
                If after this last round it's still a tie, the player with the
                black pieces win.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are separate referees for the rounds of chess and boxing,
                having these separate referees is essential. Judging any of the
                two events of the match require a specific set of expertise and
                focus. By dividing the responsibilities it helps to ensure the
                integrity and fairness of the separate events and the whole
                match.

              <li>
                Each player has a total of 12 minutes to make all their moves.
                If all 6 rounds are played, that means each player has 2 minutes
                per round.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a separate referee in the chess rounds who keeps track

              <li>
                Speed chess is the variant of chess that is played in
                chessboxing. The integration of speed chess is crucial because
                it ensures the competition moves at a brisk pace, maintaining
                the dynamic and intense pace of the match. This creates a
                balance between physically demanding boxing and strategic and
                time sensitive chess.

              The popular Netflix miniseries “The Queens Gambit” is dedicated to
              the founder Rubingh. He is credited as an “On-Set Chess
              Consultant” for the series.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the 1992 graphic novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal the rules
              were slightly different. A whole boxing match was played before
              the chess game. Rubingh thought that this was impractical and
              adjusted the rules according to his vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first chessboxing win was due to one of the players exceeding
              the time limit in chess.
            </li>
            <li>
              The chess is played on board specially designed for chessboxing,
              exactly how it differs from a regular board is a little unclear.
              It has the same dimensions as a regular board, eight by eight
              squares, and the players have the same set up of pieces as in
              regular chess. The chess clock however is not the same as a
              regular chess clock, it is adapted for speed chess.
            </li>
            <li>
              The founder Rubingh, was born on the 17th of August (1974) by pure
              coincidence, the same day of birth asthe legendary chess player
              Robert James Fischer but perhaps more importantly it is also the
              birthday of the maker of this website.

              Always remember you have decided for a combined sport, that means
              you've got to work twice as much and twice as hard as the others.
            </li>
            <li>Control yourself before your opponent does.</li>
            <li>
              If your position on the board is bad, make it a long game, when
              you're on top make it short.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never give up on the board, there will be a next round of boxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fight fair, points deduction hurts twice as much in chessboxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Give it all in every boxing round, you'll have five minutes to
              regenerate afterwards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never follow the chess speed of your opponent, control yourself
              and draw at your own speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Know your opening repertoire with black and white, the quicker you
              are in the opening game the more time you'll have in the middle
              and end game.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are superior in boxing, go for the KO, never count on a
              points win in chessboxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cool down after the boxing, never make your move too soon, you'll
              lose a few seconds on the clock, but it will pay off in the end.
