    <h3>A deeper dive into chessboxing</h3>
    <p>
      It's finally time to really get to know the sport of chessboxing. It's history, rules and some fun facts. 
      To take a deep dive into a sport that's both fascinating and unique and is capturing the interest of people all over the world. 
      Blending the intellectual challenge of chess, a game with ancient roots that continues to evolve in the modern era of online playing and AI opponents, 
      with the physical vigour of boxing, one of humanity's oldest physical contests. Chessboxing is the perfect blend of mental and physical prowess. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Historically, we've often admired either strength or smarts, but rarely both together. Chessboxing challenges this notion by requiring competitors to excel 
      in both strategic thinking and physical strength. Competitors must master and be able to switch between the focused, strategic world of chess and the intense, physically demanding realm of boxing. This demands not just intellectual sharpness or physical endurance, but a unique combination of both. 
It prompts us to reconsider our traditional view of the ideal athlete. Perhaps the quintessential chessboxing champion represents a new kind of competitor to be admired– one who embodies the best of both worlds: mental acuity and physical power. When it comes to brains or brawn, it’s not longer about choosing one over the other; it's about excelling in both arenas."

   <div class="cb-introquote container-black">
    <p>
      The founder Iepe Rubingh, is essential to the history of chessboxing, 
      so we will get hyped up with a quote from him that he uttered after his first chessboxing match.
    </p>
      <q>
        I had been fighting for 45 minutes and I was ready to drop. I mobilised every nerve-ending in my body, and landed a punch.
        I could see him struggling to find his corner. All I needed was another hit for the victory! 
        ... then the bell rang, and the the boxing round ended. 
        I wanted to scream, and the next thing I saw was the chess table in the ring, and the final round had begun...
      </q>
    <p>
      We mere mortals may be able to get a sense of what the sport is like from videos, images and stories, perhaps this quote 
      from the founder and first champion can give us insight into the extraordinary experience of stepping into the ring, 
      as well sitting down at the chess board.

    <h3>The history of chessboxing</h3>
    <p>
      Invented in 2003 by the Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, but how did he come up with the idea?
      Rubingh was inspired by the 1992 graphic novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal. 
      In the graphic novel, set in a dystopian future, a version of chessboxing is the most popular sport in the world.
      After reading this, Rubingh, being an artist
      <!-- NOTE/TO DO double check this fact (his artist name was "the Joker")  -->
      decided to create a live version of the sport as a piece of performance art. 
      Luckily, he saw the potential of the sport and decided to create a real life version but without the dystopia.
      Had it not been for this stroke of brilliance, the history of chessboxing would have ended 
      as a little known piece of performance art .

    <h2>The rules of chessboxing</h2>
    <h3>General rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The match consists of 12 rounds, 6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds of boxing.
        It starts with a round of chess and then alternates between chess and boxing.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a break of 1 minute between the rounds to allow the players to change their gear.
        It would perhaps be a bit impractical to play chess wearing boxing gloves, so luckily the players are allowed to remove these during the chess rounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        A winner can be declared and the match thus ending in 4 different ways:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Checkmate - according to the rules of chess
          </li>
          <li>
            Knockout - when a player is knocked down and the referee counts to 10 without the player getting up
          </li>
          <li>
            Technical knockout - this means that a player is knocked down three times in one round, even if they are not knocked out
          </li>
          <li>
            Exceeding the time limit in chess - this is for the whole match, not just one round.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      If all rounds are completed and none of the players have won through any of these ways, 
      a sixth and last round of boxing takes place and the player with the most boxing points from the whole game wins. 
      </li>
      <li>
      If after this last round it's still a tie, the player with the black pieces win.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are separate referees for the rounds of chess and boxing, having these separate referees is essential.
        Judging any of the two events of the match require a specific set of expertise and focus.
        By dividing the responsibilities it helps to ensure the integrity and fairness of the separate events and the whole match.

    <h3>Chess Rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Each player has a total of 12 minutes to make all their moves.
        If all 6 rounds are played, that means each player has 2 minutes per round.
        </li>
        <li>
        There is a separate referee in the chess rounds who keeps track of the time and makes sure chess rules are followed.
        </li> 
        <li>
        Speed chess is the variant of chess that is played in chessboxing.
        The integration of speed chess is crucial because it ensures the competition moves at a brisk pace, 
        maintaining the dynamic and intense pace of the match. This creates a balance between physically demanding boxing 
        and strategic and time sensitive chess.

            <li>
              make sure that the rules of boxing are followed

              ensuring the safety of the players
            </li>
            <li>
              counting down when a boxer is down to determine a knockout
            </li>

    <h3>Trivia and fun facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The popular Netflix miniseries
        “The Queens Gambit” is dedicated to the founder Rubingh. 
        He is credited as an “On-Set Chess Consultant” for the series.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the 1992 graphic novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal 
        the rules were slightly different. A whole boxing match was played before the chess game. 
        Rubingh thought that this was impractical and adjusted the rules according to his vision.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first chessboxing win was due to one of the players exceeding the time limit in chess.
      </li>
      <li>
       The chess is played on board specially designed for chessboxing, exactly how it differs from a regular board is a little unclear. 
       It has the same dimensions as a regular board, eight by eight squares, and the players have the same set up of pieces as in regular chess. 
       The chess clock however is not the same as a regular chess clock, it is adapted for speed chess.
      </li>
      <li>
        The founder Rubingh, was born on the 17th of August (1974) by pure coincidence, the same day of birth asthe legendary chess player Robert James Fischer 
        but perhaps more importantly it is also the birthday of the maker of this website.

    <h3>The ten golden rules of Chessboxing</h3>

        of the World Chessboxing Organisation. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Always remember you have decided for a combined sport, that means you've got to work twice as much and twice as hard as the others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Control yourself before your opponent does.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your position on the board is bad, make it a long game, when you're on top make it short.
        </li>
        <li>
          Never give up on the board, there will be a next round of boxing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fight fair, points deduction hurts twice as much in chessboxing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Give it all in every boxing round, you'll have five minutes to regenerate afterwards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Never follow the chess speed of your opponent, control yourself and draw at your own speed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Know your opening repertoire with black and white, the quicker you are in the opening game the more time you'll have in the middle and end game.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are superior in boxing, go for the KO, never count on a points win in chessboxing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cool down after the boxing, never make your move too soon, you'll lose a few seconds on the clock, but it will pay off in the end.
        </li>
