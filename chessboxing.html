            A deeper dive into chessboxing
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's finally time to really get to know the sport of chessboxing.
            It's history, rules and some fun facts. To take a deep dive into a
            sport that's both fascinating and unique and is capturing the
            interest of people all over the world. Blending the intellectual
            challenge of chess, a game with ancient roots that continues to
            evolve in the modern era of online playing and AI opponents, with
            the physical vigour of boxing, one of humanity's oldest physical
            contests. Chessboxing is the perfect blend of mental and physical
            prowess.
            <br>
            <br>
            Historically, we've admired either strength or smarts, but
            rarely both. Chessboxing challenges this notion by
            requiring competitors to excel in both strategic thinking and
            physical strength. Competitors must master and be able to switch
            between the focused, strategic world of chess and the intense,
            physically demanding realm of boxing. This demands not just
            intellectual sharpness or physical endurance, but a unique
            combination of both. I it prompts us to reconsider our traditional
            view of the ideal athlete. Perhaps the quintessential chessboxing
            champion represents a new kind of competitor to be admired, one
            who embodies the best of both worlds: mental acuity and physical
            power. When it comes to brains or brawn, it is not longer about
            choosing one over the other; it's about excelling in both areas.

            <h3>
              Chessboxing history
            </h3>
            <p>
              The sport came to life in 2003 through the work of the Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, but how did he
              come up with the idea? Rubingh was inspired by the 1992 graphic
              novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal. In the graphic novel, set in a
              dystopian future, a version of chessboxing is the most popular sport
              in the world. After reading this, Rubingh, being an artist decided
              to create a live version of the sport as a piece of performance art.
              Luckily, he saw the potential of the sport and decided to create a
              real life version but without the dystopia. Had it not been for this
              stroke of brilliance, the history of chessboxing would have ended as
              a little known piece of performance art.

              Brains or brawn... perhaps it's not a question of which is more impressive, but rather which is more important in order for you to prevail?
              On a personal note, I find myself wondering what kind of competitor I would be. Maybe it would be fun to try it out, but I'm not sure I would be able to handle the pressure.
              Maybe it comes as no surprise that I, the creator of this site has a background both in chess and boxing. But, more on that later as we tie this whole thing together with some reflections and a conclusion.
              But, do think about it, what part of the match do you find most impressive or interesting? 
              Are you one for the muscles or the mind? Would you rather win by checkmate or knockout? Or perhaps a better question would be, would you prefer to be loose in the ring or on the board?

          <div class="container-black">
            <h2>The rules of chessboxing</h2>
            <p>
              The match consists of 12 rounds, 6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds of
              boxing, starting with a chessround. There is a break of 1 minute
              between the rounds to allow the players to change their gear. A
              winner can be declared and the match thus ending in 4 different
              ways:
              <br />
              <b>Checkmate</b> - according to the rules of chess
              <br />
              <b>Knockout</b> - according to the rules of boxing
              <br />
              <b>Technical knockout </b>
              <br />
              <b>Exceeding the time limit in chess</b>
              <br />
              If all rounds are completed and none of the players have won
              through any of these ways, a sixth and last round of boxing takes
              place and the player with the most boxing points from the whole
              game wins. If after this last round it's still a tie, the player
              with the black pieces win.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are separate referees for the rounds of chess and boxing,
              and this is essential. Judging any of the two events of the match
              require a specific set of expertise and focus and it not likely
              that a single induvidual would be able to not just have the
              required knowledge to judge the chess part and the boxing part,
              but also be able to keep focus and switch between these two
              seemlessly. By dividing the responsibilities it helps to ensure
              the integrity and fairness of the separate events and the whole
              match.

              are the in general the same as in chess, the difference is that the players have a
              total of 12 minutes each to make all their moves. This done with the short rounds and by implementing a playing a variant of chess known as

              are the same as in regular boxing, with some exeptions. The match consists of five rounds, with sixth round added should there be a draw after the last round of chess. 
              Additionally if the tournament requires is the competitors wear protective gear, such as gear to protect their heads. Usually this is only required in amateur events, 
              but it is becoming more common in professional events. This is due to the fact that risk of injuries, especially head-injuries, are high and the WCBO takes the safety of their competitors very seriously.
              The weight-classes are also slightly different, but mostly based on the ones used in boxing. They may differ depending on a descision made by the organizers of a match or tournaments as well as if it is a professional or amateur event.
              Even if it would be great if chessboxing events attracted as many competitors as boxing, but it is still a relatively small and therefore doesn't have the same need for as many weight-classes. 
              The weight-classes are not as strict as in boxing, since the competitors are not only judged on their weight but also their skill in chess.
              Still, the weight-classes are important since the competitors need to be evenly matched for the match to be fair.

            <h3>Trivia and fun facts</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The popular Netflix miniseries “The Queens Gambit” is dedicated to
                the founder Rubingh. He is credited as an “On-Set Chess
                Consultant” for the series.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the 1992 graphic novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal the rules
                were slightly different. A whole boxing match was played before
                the chess game. Rubingh thought that this was impractical and
                adjusted the rules according to his vision.
              </li>
              <li>
                The first chessboxing win was due to one of the players exceeding
                the time limit in chess.
              </li>
              <li>
                The chess is played on board specially designed for chessboxing,
                exactly how it differs from a regular board is a little unclear.
                It has the same dimensions as a regular board, eight by eight
                squares, and the players have the same set up of pieces as in
                regular chess. The chess clock however is not the same as a
                regular chess clock, it is adapted for speed chess.
              </li>
              <li>
                The founder Iepe Rubingh, was born on the 17th of August (1974) which by pure
                coincidence is the same day of birth as the legendary chess player
                Robert James Fischer... but perhaps more importantly it is also the
                birthday of the maker of this website.

                Always remember you have decided for a combined sport, that means
                you've got to work twice as much and twice as hard as the others.
              </li>
              <li>Control yourself before your opponent does.</li>
              <li>
                If your position on the board is bad, make it a long game, when
                you're on top make it short.
              </li>
              <li>
                Never give up on the board, there will be a next round of boxing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fight fair, points deduction hurts twice as much in chessboxing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Give it all in every boxing round, you'll have five minutes to
                regenerate afterwards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Never follow the chess speed of your opponent, control yourself
                and draw at your own speed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Know your opening repertoire with black and white, the quicker you
                are in the opening game the more time you'll have in the middle
                and end game.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are superior in boxing, go for the KO, never count on a
                points win in chessboxing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cool down after the boxing, never make your move too soon, you'll
                lose a few seconds on the clock, but it will pay off in the end.

            <h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>
            <p>
              If the idea of sports that combine both a persons mind and their muscles appeals to you, as it does to me, you might be wondering where do we go from here?
              I have spent a bit more time than I'd like to admit thinking about the possibilities of other hybrid sports. In what other ways could you combine two excisting
              sports / events and create something new and exciting? I have come up with a few ideas, but none that are worth mentioning. It is something that I will continue to ponder,
              but as the internet is wonderful and I have created this site and it's contents have reached you, I am sure that you are more than capable of helping me in this endevour.
              Could it be a team sport and not a solo sport like chessboxing? Might players face different physcial challenges like in a triathlon? 
              Is it possible to create some kind of intricate obstacle course, a cross between the traditional boot-camp style but combined with puzzles or even something resembling escape rooms? 
              The possibilities really are endless once you start to think about it...

              Any ideas you might have, please share them with me through the form below*, it doesn't have to be a "complete" idea, just brainstorm and let the ideas fly free. 
              Then maybe, just maybe, together we can create the next hybrid sport that will challenge it's players as well as bring joy to spectators and fans... one can dream. Stranger things have happened, right? 
              A performance artist created a sport based on inspiration from a graphic novel and that is now played all over the world, so why not?

            Reflections and a conclusion
          </h3>
          <p>
            Apart from the reflections and thought about the sport, I would like to leave you with a personal note. You probably wonder why I have chosen to make a website about chessboxing.
            What is it about this sport that makes me want to share it? Do I practice it or is it something I admire from a distance? For starters, the story of how I found out about chessboxing is not very interesting. 
            As a lover of knowledge, trivia and things that are curious, Ihave an app that gives me a piece of trivia/random fact every time I unlock my phone.
            One day, it was there, the concept of chessboxing was introduced to me. I was intrigued. I had to know more, so naturally I googled it and I was hooked.
            Why make an entire website about it ? For the full-stack developer program I am attending, I needed to create a website and 
            combining my love of the sport and my love of coding seemed like brilliant idea (and in hindsight, it truly was).
            I also knew that it was a subject that would hopefully catch people's attention, judging by the reactions I have gotten when mentioning the sport to other people.
            <br>
            <br>
            So many things about this sport interests and fascinates me. It makes me question why we admire greath strength or a superior intellect but why are these seldom shown as compatible?
            My interest is rooted deeper than this though. My connection with chess is quite personal since it makes me feel connected to my late grandfather. Sadly, I never got to know him since he passed away when I was 1.5 years old.
            Many times I have imagined how it would be to sit down with him, just talking and maybe, playing a game of chess or two. The accounts of him that I have been told always speak of his thirst for knowledge, his love of teaching and his kindness.
            Growing up, there was never a question me or my brother had that my father didn't answer. If he didn't know the answer straight away he'd bring out the encyclopedias (yes, before smartphones and wikipedia).
            My father's way of thinking, always looking for the best solution for a problem and seeing things much like puzzles or riddles waiting to be solved. I am sure he got from his father and he passed down to me and my brother.
            So, when it comes to chess my grandfather was a very passionate player. He would play chess through the mail, just sending moves back and forth in the post and moving pieces on separate boards he set up.
            Every room in my grandparents house had at least one chessboard, otherwise it would be incomplete. Even in his office he had two or three sets, just in case, he was a Professor of geology at Lund University* for many years and the door to his office was always open for collegues and students alike.
            A trait that both me and my father have is writing everything down, making lists about what lists I need to write. My grandfather meticulously recording each game and later turning these records into bound books. I have one of these, not because I study the moves but because it is a piece of my family legacy that I treasure.

            The connection I have to boxing isn't personal in the same way but it means a lot to me all the same. My journey into boxing began around 17-19 years old. I took up the sport driven by a need to feel empowered after being bullied. 
            Learning to defend myself, particularly as a female who might not appear to be much of a fighter, made me feel strong. Feeling strong and capable was something I desperately needed and I loved the sport. I had been partaking in many other sports growing up, but none of them gave me this feeling of empowerment. 
            However, wrist injuries from there sports mainly tennis and handball, which lead to surgeries, made boxing a challenge and I couldn't continue, it was devastating. I am hoping that I may with some physcial therapy be able to return to the sport sometime, I don't think I will get too old, and if others think so well, I am really not bothered.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yes, I promise I am wrapping this up now. With these two sports being important to me, each in their own way, it is not surprising that I would be drawn to chessboxing. Discovering chessboxing was a revelation. It beautifully melded two significant yet contrasting aspects of my life. 
            Beyond the personal connection, I find the sport itself intriguing and entertaining. The blend of mental and physical challenges it presents is unique, and it's a sport I would have loved regardless. But the fact that it combines chess and boxing, both close to my heart for different reasons, makes it all the more special.
