            A deeper dive into chessboxing
          </h3>
          <p>
            It's finally time to really get to know the sport of chessboxing.
            It's history, rules and some fun facts. To take a deep dive into a
            sport that's both fascinating and unique and is capturing the
            interest of people all over the world. Blending the intellectual
            challenge of chess, a game with ancient roots that continues to
            evolve in the modern era of online playing and AI opponents, with
            the physical vigour of boxing, one of humanity's oldest physical
            contests. Chessboxing is the perfect blend of mental and physical
            prowess.
            <br>
            <br>
            Historically, we've often admired either strength or smarts, but
            rarely both together. Chessboxing challenges this notion by
            requiring competitors to excel in both strategic thinking and
            physical strength. Competitors must master and be able to switch
            between the focused, strategic world of chess and the intense,
            physically demanding realm of boxing. This demands not just
            intellectual sharpness or physical endurance, but a unique
            combination of both. I it prompts us to reconsider our traditional
            view of the ideal athlete. Perhaps the quintessential chessboxing
            champion represents a new kind of competitor to be admired, one
            who embodies the best of both worlds: mental acuity and physical
            power. When it comes to brains or brawn, it is not longer about
            choosing one over the other; it's about excelling in both areas.

            The history of chessboxing
          </h3>
          <p>
            Invented in 2003 by the Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, but how did he
            come up with the idea? Rubingh was inspired by the 1992 graphic
            novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal. In the graphic novel, set in a
            dystopian future, a version of chessboxing is the most popular sport
            in the world. After reading this, Rubingh, being an artist decided
            to create a live version of the sport as a piece of performance art.
            Luckily, he saw the potential of the sport and decided to create a
            real life version but without the dystopia. Had it not been for this
            stroke of brilliance, the history of chessboxing would have ended as
            a little known piece of performance art .

            A sport like this surely can make you question what abilities that you value the most, brains or brawn? 
            I find myself thinking that of course being good at chess is more impressive than being a strong fighter... or what do I really think?
            It almost seems improssible to decide! Perhaps it's not a question of which is more impressive, but rather which is more important in order for you to prevail?
            On a more personal note, I find myself wondering what kind of competitor I would be. Maybe it would be fun to try it out, but I'm not sure I would be able to handle the pressure.
            Maybe it comes as no surprise that I, the creator of this site has a background both in chess and boxing. But, more on that later as we tie this whole thing together with some reflections and a conclusion.
            But, do think about it, what part of the match do you find most impressive or interesting? 
            Are you one for the muscles or the mind? Would you rather win by checkmate or knockout? Or perhaps a better question would be, would you prefer to be loose in the ring or on the board?

      <!-- Rules section -->
      <section class="rules">
          <div class="container-black">
            <h2>The rules of chessboxing</h2>
            <p>
              The match consists of 12 rounds, 6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds of
              boxing, starting with a chessround. There is a break of 1 minute
              between the rounds to allow the players to change their gear. A
              winner can be declared and the match thus ending in 4 different
              ways:
              <br />
              <b>Checkmate</b> - according to the rules of chess
              <br />
              <b>Knockout</b> - according to the rules of boxing
              <br />
              <b>Technical knockout </b>
              <br />
              <b>Exceeding the time limit in chess</b>
              <br />
              If all rounds are completed and none of the players have won
              through any of these ways, a sixth and last round of boxing takes
              place and the player with the most boxing points from the whole
              game wins. If after this last round it's still a tie, the player
              with the black pieces win.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are separate referees for the rounds of chess and boxing,
              and this is essential. Judging any of the two events of the match
              require a specific set of expertise and focus and it not likely
              that a single induvidual would be able to not just have the
              required knowledge to judge the chess part and the boxing part,
              but also be able to keep focus and switch between these two
              seemlessly. By dividing the responsibilities it helps to ensure
              the integrity and fairness of the separate events and the whole
              match.

              The popular Netflix miniseries “The Queens Gambit” is dedicated to
              the founder Rubingh. He is credited as an “On-Set Chess
              Consultant” for the series.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the 1992 graphic novel "Froid Équateur" by Enki Bilal the rules
              were slightly different. A whole boxing match was played before
              the chess game. Rubingh thought that this was impractical and
              adjusted the rules according to his vision.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first chessboxing win was due to one of the players exceeding
              the time limit in chess.
            </li>
            <li>
              The chess is played on board specially designed for chessboxing,
              exactly how it differs from a regular board is a little unclear.
              It has the same dimensions as a regular board, eight by eight
              squares, and the players have the same set up of pieces as in
              regular chess. The chess clock however is not the same as a
              regular chess clock, it is adapted for speed chess.
            </li>
            <li>
              The founder Iepe Rubingh, was born on the 17th of August (1974) which by pure
              coincidence is the same day of birth as the legendary chess player
              Robert James Fischer... but perhaps more importantly it is also the
              birthday of the maker of this website.

              Always remember you have decided for a combined sport, that means
              you've got to work twice as much and twice as hard as the others.
            </li>
            <li>Control yourself before your opponent does.</li>
            <li>
              If your position on the board is bad, make it a long game, when
              you're on top make it short.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never give up on the board, there will be a next round of boxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fight fair, points deduction hurts twice as much in chessboxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Give it all in every boxing round, you'll have five minutes to
              regenerate afterwards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Never follow the chess speed of your opponent, control yourself
              and draw at your own speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Know your opening repertoire with black and white, the quicker you
              are in the opening game the more time you'll have in the middle
              and end game.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are superior in boxing, go for the KO, never count on a
              points win in chessboxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cool down after the boxing, never make your move too soon, you'll
              lose a few seconds on the clock, but it will pay off in the end.
