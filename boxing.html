          <h3>The history of boxing</h3>
          <p>
            Maybe not a very surpring to most, humans seem to have liked to
            punch each other for a very long time. Seemingly both just for fun
            and also to make important descisions, such as deciding who was
            superior and fit as a leader of a group, When humans became more
            civilised the fights were organised into an actual event, and so the
            fighting that was a common occurance in life became a sport and
            suddendly there were rules to follow.
            <br />
            <br />
            As one of the oldest sports in the world, dating back to ancient
            Greece. It was first introduced to the ancient Olympic Games in the
            7th century BC. The fight included no protective gear and no gloves.
            This is not very strange as most of the sporting events in the
            Olympic games in ancient Greece were performed in the nude.
            <br />
            <br />
            The first official recorded boxing match took place in 1681 in
            Britain when the Duke of Albemarle arranged a bout between his
            butler and his butcher. What a way to settle a dispute and make
            history at the same time! What the argument was about is not known,
            but the butcher won the match.

          <h3>Boxing in the modern era</h3>
          <p>
            It seems like a very simple sport, isn't it just two people punching
            each other until one of them gives up or is knocked out? Well, yes
            and no. A lot of strategy and technique goes into boxing, and it is
            not just about punching. But why do people like it so much? And how
            much can it evolve? How different is the boxing of today from the
            events when the first punches were thrown in an ancient time?
            <br />
            <br />
            Boxing continues to be a highly popular sport globally. It attracts
            a wide range of audiences and participants across different
            countries and cultures. Big fights, especially in heavyweight and
            welterweight divisions, still draw significant international
            attention and generate substantial revenue. Although some of the
            interest for boxing has been lost to other sports, such as MMA, it
            is still a very popular sport.
            <br />
            <br />
            Just like

            </a>
            the modern technologies have been included in the sport, such as the
            use of cameras and sensors to track the speed and force of punches.
            The way fans watch boxing changes with streaming services being the
            most common way that people watch sports if not attenting the live
            event.
            <br />
            <br />
            The fights no longer take place in the nude and although bareknuckle
            fighting still exsists, protective gear is worn, just like in
            <a
              href="chessboxing.html"
              aria-label="internal link to navigate to the page chessboxing">
              chessboxing.
            </a>
            The safety of the participants have also gotten a lot more
            attention, and there is an increased awareness of health and safety,
            particularly concerning head injuries and long-term brain health, a
            big issue that continues to influence boxing. There are ongoing
            discussions and research is done into how to make the sport safer
            for athletes.

        <div class="container-white">
          <h3>Boxing rules - an overview</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <b>first boxing rules</b>, called the Broughton's rules, were
              introduced in 1743. The rules were modified in 1838 and again in
              1853.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Rounds:</b>: a match is typically divided into rounds, ranging
              from three for amateur fights to twelve for professional bouts.
              Each round usually lasts three minutes with a one-minute rest
              period between rounds, same as in chessboxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Weight Classes:</b> boxers compete in specific weight classes
              to ensure fair and even matches. The exact number and limits of
              these classes can vary among different boxing organizations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Scoring:</b> points are awarded for clean, solid punches to the
              opponent's head and upper body. The scoring is typically done by
              three ringside judges using a 10-point system. The winner of a
              round receives 10 points, and the loser gets 9 or fewer, depending
              on the performance. For instance, if a player is knocked down,
              they lose a point.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Gear: </b>Professional boxers typically only wear gloves,
              shorts, and mouthguards. Amateur boxers may also wear headgear for
              additional protection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Referee's Role:</b> responsibilities include supervising the
              fight, ensuring the rules are followed and if needed stop a match
              if a boxer is unable to safely continue or intervene should the
              participants break the rules, for example, you're not allowed to
              bite off a piece of your opponents ear, that may lead to a foul,
              explained below.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Fouls:</b> certain actions are prohibited, such as hitting
              below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, spitting, or
              hitting with the head, shoulder, forearm, or elbow. Fouls can
              result in points deductions, disqualification, or a 'no contest'
              decision. Severe fouls can lead to a suspension or even a ban from
              the sport.

              Mike Tyson was the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title at 20 years, 4 months and 22 days old. 
              He holds the record for the fastest victory by a heavyweight, knocking out Marvis Frazier in just 30 seconds.
              He alsoholds the record for the most knockouts in a career with a total of 44.
              Most impressive and fascinating though, is not that he bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield's ear in a match in 1997, 
              but that he had a one man show on Broadway.
              <!-- NOTE / TO DO link to info about the show -->

            <li>
              The first boxing gloves were introduced in 1743 as a way to
              protect the hands of the fighters. The gloves were very thin and
              were used to hit the opponent in the face. The gloves were
              modified in 1868 to make them thicker and safer.
